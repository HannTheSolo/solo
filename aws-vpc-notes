#GENERAL Overview of VPC Components#
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) = A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS Cloud
#
Subnet = A segment of a VPCs IP address range hwere you can place groups of isolated resources
#
Internet Gateway/Egress only Internet Gateway = The amazon VPC side of a connection to the public internet for IPv4/IPv6
#
Router = Routers interconnect subnets and direct traffic between Internet gateways, virtual private gateways, NAT gateways and subnets
#
Peering Connection = Direct connection between two VPCs
#
VPC Endpoint = Private connection to public AWS services
#
NAT Instance = Enables Internet access for ec2 instances in private subnets managed by you
#
NAT Gateway = Enables Internet access for ec2 instances in private subnets managed by aws
#
Virtual Private Gateway = The Amazon VPC side of a Virtual Private Network connection
#
Customer Gateway = Customer side of a VPN connection
#
AWS Direct Connect = High speed, high bandwidth , private network connection from customer to aws
#
Security Group = instance-level firewall
#
Network ACL = subnet-level firewall
#
Elastic IPs = ???
#
Endpoint Services = ???
###

#When first creating VPC, CIDR block cannot be modified.
#The first four and last IP address are not available for use
#Recommended CIDR blocks to use from RFC 1918 ranges :
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) - 10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) - 172.31.0.0/16
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) - 192.168.0.0/20 

###
#Security Groups and ACLs
Network ACLs = they apply at the subnet level
Network ACLs are Stateless firewalls
    Stateless firewall checks for an allow rule for both connection(inbound and outbound)

#
Security Groups = they apply at the instance level, interface. they can be applied to instances in any subnet
Security Groups are Stateful firewalls
    Stateful firewall allows the return traffic automatically
        for example : you have web server running on 80 port in your environment.
        and you want to allow connections to it from the internet, you have to apply following rule to the firewall
        Protocol: HTTP; SourceIP: any; DestinationIP: 10.10.3.15; SourcePort: any; DestinationPort: 80;
        This rule will allow inbound requests to the web server running on 80 port, but you dont have to create outbound firewall rule,
        firewall will automatically allow return traffic to reach the destination.
Security group doesnt need deny rule, if there is no allow rule for the traffic, it will be denied by default.

###
#VPC Endpoints
VPC Endpoints = these are used to connect from private subnet to external s3 bucket or such service, without going out to the internet.
                there are two types of VPC Endpoints, Interface Endpoint and Gateway Endpoint

Interface Endpoint = You get Elastic Network Interface with a Private IP
                     IE uses DNS entries to redirect traffic
                     With IE you can use such services like API Gateway, CloudFormation, Cloudwatch and etc.
                     With IE you use Security Groups to controll traffic

Gateway Endpoint = A gateway that is a target for a specific route
                   GE uses prefix lists in the route table to redirect traffic
                   With GE you are limited to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB services
                   With GE you use VPC Endpoint Policies to controll traffic
